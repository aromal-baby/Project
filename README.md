Carbon Footprint Calculator

A web-based application that helps individuals and organizations calculate their carbon footprint based on energy consumption, waste management, and business travel data. The application provides visual representations of carbon emissions through interactive graphs and detailed breakdowns.
Getting Started
These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
Prerequisites

Python 3.8 or higher
Flask framework
SQLite database
Modern web browser
pip (Python package installer)

Required Python packages:
CopyFlask
Flask-SQLAlchemy
Flask-Login
Flask-Migrate
Werkzeug
matplotlib
Installing

Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash git clone [https://github.com/aromal-baby/Project]

Navigate to the project directory:

bash cd [E:\Official\University\Project]

Install required dependencies:

bashCopypip install -r requirements.txt

Initialize the database:

python run.py

Start the development server:

flask run
The application should now be running at http://127.0.0.1:5000
I run this program through vscode so it is always in this address

Running Tests
Currently, the application doesn't include automated tests. Future versions will include unit tests and integration tests.
Deployment
For deployment to a production environment:

Update the config.py file with production settings
Set up a production-grade server (e.g., Gunicorn)
Configure a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx)
Set up SSL certificates for HTTPS
Configure environment variables for sensitive data

Built With
